# Summary
This repository will store every file that is related with the thesis project for the Master of Science in Applied Mathematics at the University of Groningen. **NEVER** upload it to `Github` because it contains credentials that Microsoft in general shouldn't have.

Figures, graphs, images, etc..., things that generally can't or shouldn't be stored on 'Git', will be saved **once per week** on the samba share drive, to prevent any loss of useful data. 

# To-Do List
- [x] Create a script that saves ALL data (apart from .git) into the samba share. This has been started, but it needs some polishing due to errors.
- [x] Finalize the proposal page.
- [x] Get approval and gather relevant literature.
- [ ] Initialize a public repository on Github which you can share with the supervisors. It should contain non critical information.
- [ ] Find a way to store the papers folder online. Probably in the Google Drive of my university account. Also share this in Slack.
